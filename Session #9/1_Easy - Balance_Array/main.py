Easy Problem: "Balanced Array"

Problem Statement:
    Given an integer array nums of even length, determine if it is possible to 
    split the array into two equal length parts where the sum of the elements in 
    the first half is equal to the sum of the elements in the second half. 
    Return true  if such a split is possible, otherwise return false.

Constraints:
    2 <= nums.length <= 1000
    nums.length is even.
    -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Examples:
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 0]
        Output: true
        Explanation: The array can be split into [1, 2] and [3, 0], where both parts sum to 3.
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
        Output: true
        Explanation: The array can be split into [2, 3, 1] and [2, 3, 1], where both parts sum to 6.
    Example 3:
        Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 3]
        Output: false
        Explanation: There is no way to split the array into two parts with equal sums.
